The next player must bet the\nminimum bet. These mandatory upfront bets are called the\nsmall and big blinds.\n\nThe player after the second blind can then choose to __call__\n(bet the minimum), __raise__ (bet more than the minimum), or\n__fold__ (not play this round).\n\nBetting goes around the table. It is then time for the\n\"flop\". Three cards are dealt face up. These are shared\namongst all players. For example, if you have a King and\nanother King comes up on the flop, then you have a pair of\nKings.\n\nAfter the flop, there's another round of betting. Then, a\n4th shared card is dealt face up. Then more betting.\nFinally, a 5th shared card is dealt followed by a round of\nbetting.\n\nAny players still in the game can then show their cards.\nThe player with the best 5-card hand is the winner.\n\n## Poker Hand Rankings\n\n![Poker Hand Rankings Chart](//images.ctfassets.net/4tlsutsg5se1/10sqEQwJln0RuVIHy1K3JW/5f220054ed00ff38dfa8fdf3d4a8fde6/Poker_Hand_Rankings_Chart.jpg)"
